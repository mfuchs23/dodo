    <p>The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and
      manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated independently
      of the details of their representation. It reduces programming effort
      while increasing performance. It allows for interoperability among
      unrelated APIs, reduces effort in designing and learning new APIs, and
      fosters software reuse. The framework is based on six collection
      interfaces. It includes implementations of these interfaces, and
      algorithms to manipulate them.</p>
