    <h1>Security</h1> 

    <p>Security enhancements for the JavaTM 2 SDK, Standard
      Edition, v 1.4.1 include the following:</p> 

    <ul>
      <li>Three new security tools were added in the 1.4.1 release of the Java
        2 platform: kinit, klist, and ktab. These tools help users obtain, list
        and manage Kerberos tickets. See the Security Tools section of the
        JavaTM 2 SDK Tools and Utilities documentation for more
        information.</li>

      <li>The Sun SecureRandom implementation now also makes use of an
        operating system-provided entropy source on Windows platforms, which
        can improve the startup time of cryptographic applications
        considerably. Edit the &lt;java.home&gt;/lib/security/java.security to
        control this feature.</li>
 
    </ul>
