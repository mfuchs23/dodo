<h1>e-novative DocBook Environment (eDE)</h1>

<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">

<p>
The <b>&gt;e-novative&gt; DocBook Environment (eDE)</b> is a
free, ready-to-go integrated DocBook environment for Win32 systems enabling
you to create single html pages, multiple html pages and PDF documents from
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">DocBook</a>
XML source files.
</p>

<h3>Enjoy the simplicity of DocBook on Windows</h3>

<p>Using DocBook has many <a href="http://docbook.e-novative.de/advantages.html">advantages</a>
over using a regular word processor. A short overview of eDE
<a href="http://docbook.e-novative.de/features.html">features</a> is also available.
eDE was designed with the average user in mind. <b>No special</b> XML, HTML,
CSS, XSL or even Windows <b>knowledge</b> is required to install and use eDE.
eDE <b>installs</b> on Win32 systems <b>in a few seconds</b>, does not mess up any
registry or put anything into a Windows directory.
The document generation is performed by batch files so you only have to enter
one command to create output. Since eDE is command-line-oriented, all
tasks are particularly <b>easy to automate</b>.
eDE currently supports single HTML page, multiple HTML pages and PDF output; HTML Help
support will be added soon, other formats like Plain Text, Postscript and Latex might
be added in the future.</p>

<h3>Free Download</h3>

<p>
eDE 0.5.1 was first released on Sept 16th, 2002 by e-novative GmbH, Munich, Germany.
and has been <b>downloaded</b> more than <b>1000 times</b> since then.
Thank you for the trust. We´ll keep on working hard to make eDE the world´s leading
DocBook environment for Windows.
</p>

<p>eDE is available for free <a href="http://docbook.e-novative.de/download.html">download</a>.
e-novative is constantly working to improve eDE, particularly in documenting
all parameters and settings that the DocBook transformations offer.
Your feedback is most welcome.

<h2>e-novative DocBook Environment (eDE) News</h2>

<h3>Oct, 23rd, 2002: eDE forum</h3> 

<p>
David John, working on the eDe manual, and Tab Hockamier, working on the eDE GUI, are on the <a href="http://www.e-novative.de/forum/list.php?f=1">forum</a>.
eDE users, please visit the forum and help us with your comments and
suggestions. Chances are good that you'll see your ideas and requests
showing up in eDE soon. </p>

<h3>Oct, 17th, 2002: eDE GUI on the way</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.codexsoftware.com/">Tab Hockamier</a>, a Phoenix-based Windows and GUI developer with over
15 years of experience has volunteered to create a GUI to eDE.
We are looking forward to working together with Tab. Anybody
who wants to contribute or comment can contact
Tab via the forum at <a href="http://www.e-novative.de/list.php?f=1">www.e-novative.de/forum</a>. Thanks for joining in, Tab!  
</p> 

<h3>Oct 9th, 2002: eDE user forum created</h3>

<p>
A support and discussion forum for eDE users has been set up to
offer  the growing number of users a place to ask questions
and share information.
Have a look at <a href="http://www.e-novative.de/forum/list.php?f=1">http://www.e-novative.de/forum/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Oct 8th, 2002: eDE 0.6.0 released</h3>

<p>
With version 0.6.0, eDE takes a big leap towards where we want to end up:
you are in full control of document creation and transformation <b>without</b>
requiring any operating system command. All eDE batches were rewritten to be
more flexible and have a better error handling.
The "official" documentation of all XSL parameters has begun, more
parameter documentation is on the way in forthcoming releases.
You can easily create document-specific stylesheets and using the new automated backup
and restore mechanism you don´t have to worry about individual files, but can think
of an eDE DocBook document as a whole.
</p>

<p><b>We strongly recommend all users to upgrade to eDE 0.6.0.</b> since
working with eDE 0.6.0 has become much easier, and some 0.5.x bugs are fixed.</p>

<p>

</p>


<h3>Oct 7th, 2002: eDE User Manual on the way</h3>

<p>
David John, a London-based technical writer, has volunteered
to create a comprehensive user documentation for eDE.
The document will focus on customizing eDE to user needs.
e-novative will help David out with as much support and information
as possible, and we are already eager to see the first versions
of David's documentation. Thanks for joining in, David!
</p>


<h3>Oct 3rd, 2002: eDE 0.5.3 released</h3>

<p>
eDE 0.5.3 features <b>fully automated deployment</b> of all output formats as zip files
along with some minor changes and improvements. You can now define and use XML <b>entities</b>,
either local to one document or global to all documents. This lets you include
repeating text in one or multiple documents in a snap.
A section on upgrading eDE has been
included in the documentation (<a href="http://docbook.e-novative.de/changes.txt">full changelog</a>).
